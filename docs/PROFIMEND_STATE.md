# PROFIMEND STATE

## Current State

- The system currently relies on a monolithic architecture where various agents are tightly integrated within a single service.
- The existing agents perform various tasks such as processing, data handling, and communication with external services.

## Backlog

- Create a separate agent orchestrator service to manage and coordinate the various agents. This service will improve modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the system.
  
## Future Improvements

- Refine the existing agents for better performance.
- Implement monitoring and logging capabilities for the agents.
- Explore opportunities for containerization of agent services to facilitate deployment and scalability.
